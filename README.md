Getting Started
Follow the instructions below to get started with this repository:

Prerequisites
To use the code in this repository, you'll need the following:

Python (>= 3.6)
Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for data exploration and visualization)
Required Python libraries (see requirements.txt for a list)
Project Structure
data/: Store your transaction data here in CSV, Excel, or other compatible formats.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
src/: Python scripts and modules for market basket analysis.
results/: Directory to save generated reports, charts, and analysis results.
config/: Configuration files, if applicable.
requirements.txt: List of required Python packages.
Usage
Data Preparation: Place your transaction data in the data/ directory. You may need to preprocess the data to have it in the right format, such as a list of transactions or a binary matrix.

Run Analysis: Use the provided Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to perform market basket analysis. Customize the analysis according to your specific requirements, such as minimum support, confidence, and lift values.

Visualization: Create visualizations and reports to understand the results of the analysis. Save these reports in the results/ directory.

Interpret Results: Interpret the discovered associations and use them for business decisions. This may include optimizing store layouts, creating promotions, and enhancing product recommendations.

Example
A common example of market basket analysis is finding associations between products in a retail store. For instance, if customers who buy bread are also likely to buy butter, this association can lead to strategic decisions like placing bread and butter close together on store shelves.

You can find example Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory that demonstrate how to perform market basket analysis with sample data.
